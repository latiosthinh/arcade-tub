## Decisions
- Tech: Vite 7 + TypeScript + pnpm workspaces + Canvas 2D
- Platform: YouTube Playables (static iframe games)
- Structure: One folder per game, shared playables-adapter package
- No external game engine — raw Canvas 2D API with lightweight in-house GameLoop/InputManager/SceneManager
- Original IP — no third-party characters or names
- TypeScript project references + composite tsconfig per workspace project
